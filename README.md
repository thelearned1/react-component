# README

react-component is a script for creating new components in a React.JS project
following the convention described by Josh W. Comeau:

<https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/>

## INSTALLATION

No installation is required.  If you like, you can add this script to a location
on your `$PATH` of your choice.

## OPERATION

There are no flags and no toggles.  Currently, arguments are accepted in the
following format:

```
  react-component arg1 arg2 ... argn
```

That yields a file structure like this:

```
./
├── arg1
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── arg1.js
│   └── arg1.module.css
...
└── argn
    ├── index.js
    ├── argn.js
    └── argn.module.css
```

## MANIFEST

```
./
├── react-component
├── README.md
└── COPYING.md
```
